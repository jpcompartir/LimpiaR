<p>In this vignette we’ll be looking at how to use LimpiaR to process a
text variable for its parts of speech via {udpipe}. For a primer on
parts of speech see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_of_speech" class="external-link">Parts of Speech
Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>The main motivation for processing and extraction parts of speech is
to home in on the particular aspects of language which are most
informative for answering a given research question. For example, if you
want to know what people think about something, you might focus on
adjectives and nouns. If you want to know how people are using
something, you might focus more on verbs/phrasal verbs.</p>
<p>Before we start, we must ensure that we have the necessary libraries
installed and loaded, including LimpiaR, and a few others for data
wrangling purposes.</p>

<p>LimpiaR’s Parts of Speech(POS) workflow leans on existing
functionality of {udpipe} and allow for users to import one of their
existing trained models for parts of speech analysis, to later annotate
texts by tokenizing(breaking sentences up into words) and also enables
users to perform dependency parsing on tokens, ‘a technique which
provides to each word in a sentence the link to another word in the
sentence, which is called its syntactical head. This link between each 2
words furthermore has a certain type of relationship giving you further
details about it’, see <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/2019/07/dependency-parsing-with-udpipe/" class="external-link">here</a>
for more.</p>
<p>First, we must select what model it is that that we want to download.
UDPipe pre-trained models are built upon Universal Dependencies
treebanks and are made available for more than 65 languages based on 101
treebanks. For the purpose of this documentation, we will select the
‘english’ model, and we can do so using the
<code><a href="../reference/limpiar_pos_import_model.html">limpiar_pos_import_model()</a></code> function and supplying its only
argument, <code>language</code> with the desired model we want.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="va">model</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">LimpiaR</span><span class="fu">::</span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/limpiar_pos_import_model.html">limpiar_pos_import_model</a></span><span class="op">(</span>language <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"english"</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>For the purpose of this demo, lets use the data object derived from
the {stringr} package containing sentences ideal for tagging,
tokenizing, lemmatizing and parsing for parts of speech analysis.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="va">data</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">dplyr</span><span class="fu">::</span><span class="fu"><a href="https://tibble.tidyverse.org/reference/tibble.html" class="external-link">tibble</a></span><span class="op">(</span>text <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/chartr.html" class="external-link">tolower</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="fu">stringr</span><span class="fu">::</span><span class="va"><a href="https://stringr.tidyverse.org/reference/stringr-data.html" class="external-link">sentences</a></span><span class="op">[</span><span class="fl">1</span><span class="op">:</span><span class="fl">100</span><span class="op">]</span><span class="op">)</span>, document <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fl">1</span><span class="op">:</span><span class="fl">100</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we have our data and we should have our loaded model, we can
begin annotating with the <code><a href="../reference/limpiar_pos_annotate.html">limpiar_pos_annotate()</a></code>
function.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that the output can entirely depend on any cleaning
steps performed on texts before annotating. For example, it is possible
that with the removal of punctuation the dependency parsing bits of the
function may under-perform. This could also be said for the POS tagging
process as nouns(PRON) and proper-nouns(PROPN) will be harder to
differentiate if punctuation is removed as well as all text being
lowercase.</p>
<p>When using LimpiaR’s annotate function we tokenize all sentences of
our text variable(text_var) within a selected data frame object(data),
enabling us to perform Parts of Speech tagging and lemmatization on
tokens. We can also speed this process up by calling <code>TRUE</code>
on the parallel processing argument(in_parallel). The user can also
decide whether to parse tokens for term dependencies, by supplying the
parse_text argument with a logical input which is <code>FALSE</code> by
default as this step can be expensive on compute and memory if performed
on large sets of data unnecessarily. When using
<code><a href="../reference/limpiar_pos_annotate.html">limpiar_pos_annotate()</a></code> its important to supply the id_var
with an appropriate identifying variable. This can either be;
universal_message_id, doc_id, doc_number or anything similar that
represents a unique document of text upon which the annotations are
conducts upon.</p>

<pre><code><span><span class="co">## Performing dependency parsing on tokens....</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Now that we have texts tokenized, parsed and parts of speech
annotations are complete. Lets take a look at the output.</p>

first observation might be that the data frame output is
significantly larger than the one we provided in terms of row number.
This is due to each row now representing an annotation of each token
derived from sentences belonging to documents. We may also see columns;
token, lemma, pos_tag and dependency_tag, all of which can be useful for
a number of NLP workflows.</p>
<p>First we must understand what they all mean. Starting with
<code>paragraph_id</code> and <code>sentence_id</code>, we see the
identifying value for both the sentence in which the annotated token is
derived, as well as the paragraph. As the example data consists of
sentences its likely that the values here for paragraph_id and
sentence_id will match given that no document consists of more than one
sentence in this case. We then of course have the <code>sentence</code>
in question along with the <code>token</code> being annotated along with
its respective <code>lemma</code>(the token in its root form),
understanding the lemma column can be best visualized when looking at
row number 43 where ‘served’ of document 5 becomes ‘serve’ once
lemmatized.</p>
<p>We then see <code>pos_tag</code>, <code>head_token_id</code> and
<code>dependency_tag</code>. Starting with pos_tag(or Parts of Speech
tag), this column is where information regarding how tokens are
classified as any of the parts of speech labels such as; Noun(NOUN),
Proper Noun(PROPN), Pronoun(PRON), Verb(VERB), Adjective(ADJ) etc. For
more on the exact tags and what they mean see <a href="https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/index.html" class="external-link">here</a>. Then
we have columns; <code>head_token_id</code> and
<code>dependency_tag</code> which we will need to conduct dependency
parsing analysis on our documents. If the user calls parse_text = FALSE,
then dependency tags will show as NA. These two columns important and
closely linked as dependency_tag shows the relationship the annotated
token has with the head_token_id.</p>
<p>So now we have a bit more context as to what all of this for
information means, lets dive in and see if we can manipulate this data
so we can see what adjectives are most common in their lemmatized form.
To do so we only require some basic {dplyr} functionality and we will
use <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/head.html" class="external-link">head()</a></code> to only select the top 10.</p>
