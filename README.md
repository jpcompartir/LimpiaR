# LimpiaR

## What is LimpiaR?

LimpiaR is an R library of functions for cleaning & pre-processing text data.

Limpiar is a Spanish verb and translates in English to 'to clean'. So generally, when you're calling a LimpiaR function, you can think of it as 'clean...'

LimpiaR is primarily used for cleaning messy text data, such as that which comes from social media or reviews. In its initial release, it is focused around the Spanish language, however, some of its functions are language-ambivalent.
