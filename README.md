# LimpiaR

## What is LimpiaR?

LimpiaR is an R library of pre-processing functions for text data.

For non-Spanish speakers, limpiar is a Spanish verb and translates in English to 'to clean'. So generally, when you're calling a LimpiaR function, you can think of it as 'clean...'

LimpiaR is primarily used for cleaning messy text-data, such as that which comes from social media or reviews. In its initial release, it is focused around the Spanish language, but some of its functions are language-ambivalent.
