## What is LimpiaR?

LimpiaR is an R library of functions for cleaning & pre-processing text
data. The name comes from ‘limpiar’ the Spanish verb’to clean’.
Generally when calling a LimpiaR function, you can think of it as
‘clean…’.

LimpiaR is primarily used for cleaning unstructured text data, such as
that which comes from social media or reviews. In its initial release,
it is focused around the Spanish language, however, some of its
functions are language-ambivalent.
